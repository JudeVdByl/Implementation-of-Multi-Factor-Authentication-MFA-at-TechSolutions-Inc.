# Implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) at TechSolutions Inc.

## Summary
This project aimed to strengthen the cybersecurity framework at TechSolutions Inc. by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems. The objective was to mitigate the risks associated with single-factor authentication, which had previously led to several security breaches. The project followed a structured approach using Agile methodology and involved extensive stakeholder collaboration, training, and system integration. The outcome was a significant enhancement in the organization's security posture, compliance with industry standards, and improved employee awareness and adherence to secure practices.

## Objective
Enhance the security posture of TechSolutions Inc. by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to weak single-factor authentication methods.

## Skills Learned
- **Cybersecurity Implementation**: Gained hands-on experience in deploying MFA solutions and aligning them with industry standards such as NIST and Zero Trust Architecture.
- **Project Management**: Managed the project using Agile methodology, ensuring iterative progress and timely feedback.
- **Stakeholder Management**: Engaged with internal and external stakeholders to align the project objectives with organizational security goals.

## Tools Used
- **MFA Solutions**: Google Workspace, Okta, Microsoft Azure
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Splunk for real-time monitoring and logging
- **Project Management Tools**: Agile methodologies and related tools
- **Training Platforms**: Learning Management System for employee training

## Project Scope
- **Company-Wide Implementation**: MFA was deployed across all departments to secure critical systems and data.
- **Training and Support**: Provided comprehensive training sessions for all employees to ensure smooth adoption of the new authentication process.
